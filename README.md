# film-exif

An analog photography tool for recording and assigning metadata to scanned film images.

## Overview

Many of the modern conveniences of a digital camera are not available when using a film camera. For example, information about the photo-taking conditions are not recorded, which can be crucial in learning photography or troubleshooting an old camera. Some photographers write notes while taking photos to refer back on, but this can be confusing, especially if it is a large collection.

`film-exif` is a two-part tool that records photo conditions, and assigns Exif tags to the JPEG files scanned from film.



## Recording Conditions

When taking photos, this tool is used alongside the camera to make note of picture-taking conditions such as aperture and shutter speed. After the film is developed and scanned, an XML file can be generated for use with the second part of the tool.

Aperture is referred to by f-numbers, represented by a `double`. The standard full-stop f-number scale is listed here for reference:

1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22

Shutter speed is referred to by (fractions of) seconds, and are represented by a `double`. Common shutter speeds and the equivalent `double` are listed here for convenience:

| Shutter Speed | double |
| :-----------: | :----: |
|    1/1000     | 0.001  |
|     1/500     | 0.002  |
|     1/250     | 0.004  |
|     1/125     | 0.008  |
|     1/60      | 0.016  |
|     1/30      |  0.03  |
|     1/15      |  0.06  |
|      1/8      | 0.125  |
|      1/4      |  0.25  |
|      1/2      |  0.5   |
|       1       |   1    |



## Exif Assignment

Using the XML file generated by the first tool, each of the JPEG files scanned from the film are assigned the corresponding Exif tags. The metadata assignment is accomplished by creating a new APP1 segment with the XML information, and inserting it into the JPEG file. There are no modifications to the rest of the file, so only the metadata is changed. This is done to each scanned image of the roll of film.

The section below gives a brief outline on the structure of a JPEG file and shows how the replacement APP1 segment is generated.



#### JPEG Structure (Simplified)

| Name                 | Hex Marker |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| SOI (Start of Image) | 0xFFD8     |
| APPn                 | 0xFFEn     |
| ...                  |            |
| EOI (End of Image)   | 0xFFD9     |

APPn segments are application specific, and the first 2 bytes of which denote which APP segment it is. Multiple segments of the same type can exist within the same JPEG file. Exif information is stored in APP1, which appears after SOI and APP0 (if it exists). Other segments exist in the `...`, containing information such as the thumbnail information and the compressed image data. `film-exif` does not deal with them; only with APP1. 

However, there may be existing APP1 segments (and therefore existing Exif information) from scanners or software used to create the JPEG - `film-exif` will delete these since they do not reflect the photographic conditions of the film camera.

##### APP1

| Name        | Content                                             | Hex                  | Size (Bytes) |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| APP1 Size   | Size (including size marker, excluding APP1 marker) | 0xXXXX               | 2            |
| Exif Header | "Exif\null\null"                                    | 0x4578 0x6966 0x0000 | 6            |
| TIFF Header | "II" for little endian, "MM" for big endian         | 0x4949               | 2            |
|             | TIFF ID (always the same)                           | 0x2A00               | 2            |
|             | Offset to 0th IFD (from TIFF Header; 8 bytes)       | 0x0800 0x0000        | 4            |

Note that `film-exif` uses little-endian, and all hex numbers are represented here as such.

Inside APP1, Image Frame Directories (IFDs) organize the information. There are a number of IFDs, but `film-exif` only uses IFD0 and the EXIF IFD, which appear in that order after the APP1 header. IFD0 is a "table of contents" for other IFDs in APP1, while EXIF IDFs contain the Exif information. IFDs have the following structure:

##### IFDs

| Name                                  | Size (Bytes)   |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| IFD Size                              | 2              |
| Directory (each field in TIFF Format) | 12 (per entry) |
| ...                                   |                |
| Next IFD Offset                       | 4              |
| IFD Data Area                         | Variable       |
| ...                                   |                |

##### TIFF Format (IFD Field Format)

| Name    | Notes                                                        | Size (Bytes) |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Tag ID  | These are non-unique across IFDs!                            | 2            |
| Type ID | 1 - Byte<br />2 - Byte Array (ie. ASCII)<br />3 - Short (uint16)<br />4 - Long (uint32)<br />5 - Rational (2 * uint32)<br />7 - Undefined (byte array)<br />9 - SLong (int32)<br />10 - SRational (2 * int32) | 2            |
| Count   | ie. Number of components                                     | 4            |
| Value   | If value is greater than 4 bytes, this contains offset to the data in the data area | 4            |

A list of EXIF and TIFF tags can be found at https://exiftool.org/TagNames/EXIF.html

In our case, IFD0 only contains one entry in the directory: the EXIF IFD Offset. EXIF IFD lists each metadata metric that we are interested in. As an example, aperture and shutter speed are recorded as Type 5, and in the data area the 2 `uint32`'s are divided to produce the result. The XML file data is converted and populates these fields. Since the recording part of `film-exif` records a small number of metrics (compared to a digital camera), our generated APP1 segment is relatively short.

## Assumptions

- `film-exif` can only parse JPEG files.
- There can be multiple APP1 segments in one JPEG file, and `film-exif` assumes that all existing metadata is a result from the scanner/software, and will delete all existing APP1 segments before writing its own.

## Potential Features

After basic functionality is completed, the following features may be implemented:

- Different f-number scales (eg. half stop, third stop)
- Custom f-number scales (ie. for different lenses that have specific f-stops)
- More metadata: eg. time/date, focal length, make/model of camera, etc.
