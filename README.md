# film-exif

An analog photography tool for recording and assigning metadata to scanned film images.

## Overview

Many of the modern conveniences of a digital camera are not available when using a film camera. For example, information about the photo-taking conditions are not recorded, which can be crucial in learning photography or troubleshooting an old camera. Some photographers write notes while taking photos to refer back on, but this can be confusing, especially if it is a large collection.

film-exif is a two-part tool that records photo conditions, and assigns Exif tags to the JPEG files scanned from film.



## Recording Conditions

When taking photos, this tool is used alongside the camera to make note of picture-taking conditions such as aperture and shutter speed. After the film is developed and scanned, an XML file can be generated for use with the second part of the tool.

Aperture is referred to by f-numbers, represented by a `double`. The standard full-stop f-number scale is listed here for reference:

1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22

Shutter speed is referred to by (fractions of) seconds, and are represented by a `double`. Common shutter speeds and the equivalent `double` are listed here for convenience:

| Shutter Speed | double |
| :-----------: | :----: |
|    1/1000     | 0.001  |
|     1/500     | 0.002  |
|     1/250     | 0.004  |
|     1/125     | 0.008  |
|     1/60      | 0.016  |
|     1/30      |  0.03  |
|     1/15      |  0.06  |
|      1/8      | 0.125  |
|      1/4      |  0.25  |
|      1/2      |  0.5   |
|       1       |   1    |



## Exif Assignment

Using the XML file generated by the first tool, each of the JPEG files scanned from the film are assigned the corresponding Exif tags.



## Potential Features

After basic functionality is completed, the following features may be implemented:

- Different f-number scales (eg. half stop, third stop)
- Custom f-number scales (ie. for different lenses that have specific f-stops)
- More metadata: eg. time/date, focal length, make/model of camera, etc.
